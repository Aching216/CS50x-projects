Title: Save the falling squirrels from the lava!
Lava has shaken up the tree making these tree squirrels anxious! Save the poor squirrel from the lava by moving your hands! Keep them from falling into the lava. 
This game uses a webcam.

A remix from Eric's project "Save the Minifigs" with a simplified script and a new theme and sprite.
